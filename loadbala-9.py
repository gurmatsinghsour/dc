'''This code defines a LoadBalancer class with a list of server names passed as an argument. 
The next_server() method returns the next server in the list according to the Round Robin algorithm.

Here's how the example works:

We create a list of server names.
We instantiate a LoadBalancer object with the list of server names.
We simulate 10 incoming requests by calling next_server() method each time and printing the 
server to which the request is routed.
This is a very basic implementation for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, 
you may need to consider factors such as server health checks, server weights, and request/response processing times.'''
